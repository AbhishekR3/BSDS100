# Week 2: Exploratory Data Analysis: Visualization

By **James D. Wilson** at the University of San Francisco (http://jdwilson-statistics.com)

This week, we will begin by learning about one of the most central components of making data-driven decisions: **visualization**. Visualization is a key component of the larger task of *exploratory data analysis*, or EDA. EDA refers to the act of visualizing, modeling, and transforming data so that important hypotheses and conclusions can be communicated. The process of data analysis is shown below in a flow chart from Hadley Wichkam's book:

[John Tukey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Tukey), a famous statistician is often considered one of the ``fathers`` of exploratory data analysis, was the first to write a book about exploratory data analysis and its use in statistics (in 1977!). His belief about the importance of EDA can be observed in one of his famous quotes:

> Far better an approximate answer to the right question, which is often vague, than an exact answer to the wrong question, which can always be made precise.
