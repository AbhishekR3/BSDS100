# Week 2: Exploratory Data Analysis: Visualization

By **James D. Wilson** at the University of San Francisco (http://jdwilson-statistics.com)

This week, we will begin by learning about one of the most central components of making data-driven decisions: **visualization**. Visualization is a key component of the larger task of *exploratory data analysis*, or EDA. EDA refers to the act of visualizing, modeling, and transforming data so that important hypotheses and conclusions can be communicated. The process of data analysis is shown below in a flow chart from Hadley Wickham's book:

[John Tukey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Tukey), a famous statistician is often considered one of the "fathers" of exploratory data analysis, was the first to write a book about exploratory data analysis and its use in statistics (in 1977!). His belief about the importance of EDA can be observed in one of his famous quotes:

> Far better an approximate answer to the right question, which is often vague, than an exact answer to the wrong question, which can always be made precise. 

About visualization, Tukey went on to say 

> The simple graph has brought more information to the data analystâ€™s mind than any other device.

With this in mind, let's explore what kinds of things we can do with visualization using Hadley Wickham's package *ggplot2*.
