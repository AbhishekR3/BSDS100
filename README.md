##Course Learning Outcomes

By the end of this course, you will be able to

- Proficiently wrangle, manipulate, and explore data using the R programming language
- Utilize contemporary R libraries including *ggplot2*, *tibble*, *tidyr*, *dplyr*, *knitr*, and *stringr*
- Visualize, present, and communicate trends in a variety of data types
- Communicate results using R markdown and R Shiny graphical user interfaces
- Formulate data-driven hypotheses using exploratory data analysis and introductory model building techniques

##A Few Important Tid bits

###Assessment

The focus of this course will be to provide you with the basic techniques available for making informed, data-driven decisions using the R programming language. This is *not* a statistics course, but will provide you the intuition to make hypotheses about complex questions through visualization, wrangling, manipulation, and exploration of data. The course will be graded based on the following components:

- **Attendence** (10%): You will lose 1% of this grade for every course you miss.
- **Quizzes** (20%): There will be roughly one quiz per week that will contain one to two questions about material covered in class up to that point. These are meant to check your progress on key ideas covered in class.
- **Assignments** (50%): Every Thursday, you will be assigned a computational assignment to be completed using RStudio and the package *knitr* that will be turned by the following class on Tuesday. You will be working in groups to complete these assignments in class so that I can be there to help with questions.
- **Final Exam** (20%): The final exam is a cumulative exam that will assess the concepts learned throughout this course.
